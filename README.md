## Description

Project Duration: 2 Week Sprint

TravelEats gives you the ability to create restaurant listings and use those listings as a travel journal as well. When you are traveling, it can be very frustrating and difficult to find restaurant recommendations you can trust. Public anonymous listings can be suspect, or purchased, or created out of thin air. It is also difficult while traveling to keep track of where you have gone to eat, and your feelings and enjoyment level while you were eating. TravelEats is the simple and elegant solution to these problems.
